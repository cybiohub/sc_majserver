# Majserver
This script is used to update Linux systems (Ubuntu and Debian) with the apt-get command. A basic script, but which allows you to,

- Speed up the update by forcing the use of IPv4 only.
- Generate an execution log for logging.
- Allows better control for technicians unfamiliar with Linux.
- Prevents the execution of some tasks if a restart of the system is necessary.
